        Environmental Science provides an overview of how science affects our environment. We focus on interactions between the solid Earth, its water, its air and its living organisms, and on dynamic, interdependent relationships between these four components.

Earth and environmental scientists also consider how these relationships produce environmental change at different timescales. To do this, they combine knowledge, models and methods drawn from geology, biology, physics and chemistry.

We also strive to understand past and present environmental processes so that reliable and scientifically based predictions can be made about the future.
